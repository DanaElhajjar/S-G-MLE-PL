# S-G-MLE-PL

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of Sequential Gaussian Phase Linking based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (S-G-MLE-PL). This approach aims to estimate the phase of a new SAR image based on a block of past images.

The repository provides reproduction of the results presented in the paper:
