This paper presents a novel sequential \acs{PL} approach that allows incorporating efficiently new \acs{SAR} images in interferometric phase estimation in a \acs{PL} framework. According to synthetic simulations and real data applications, the proposed \acs{SMLEPL} approach presents the same performance and lower computational cost compared to \acs{MLEPL}. % \citep{vu2022new}.
